Main Layout Components:

Header: The section at the top (including user input like "Game face on! What's on your mind?").
Sidebar: The left sidebar with menu options (Home, Search, Notifications, etc.).
Main Content Area: The central feed area (posts and related actions).
Right Sidebar: The section on the right (Upcoming Matches, Tip of the Day, etc.).
Component Breakdown:

Header Component:
The part where the user can post or add content (Text input, buttons like "Post", "Add Score").
Sidebar Component:
A list of items (Home, Search, etc.). You can pass these as props to render dynamically.
Post Component:
For displaying each post in the feed (includes text, image, icons, and like/share/comment buttons).
Match Card Component:
For upcoming matches (team and individual matches). Each match could be a separate component.
User Stats Component:
For the game stats like trophies, coins, etc.
Tip Component:
To display the "Tip of the Day".
Responsive Design Approach:

Grid Layout: Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to manage the layout. The left and right sidebars can collapse on smaller screens, allowing the main content to take up more space.
Media Queries: Adjust the size and layout of each component based on screen width. For example:
On larger screens: Keep the three-column layout (Sidebar, Main Feed, Right Sidebar).
On smaller screens: Collapse the sidebars into dropdown menus or slide-in panels and make the main content occupy the full width.
Reusable Components:

Icons and Buttons: Like the comment, like, and share buttons, could be their own reusable components.
Match List: Create a list component to render each match card dynamically, based on the match data.
